#ques). create student class that takes name and marks of 3 subject as argument in constructor then create a method to print the avg

class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, marks):
        self.name = name
        self.marks = marks
    
    def get_avg(self):
        total_marks = sum(self.marks)
        avg_score = total_marks / len(self.marks)
        print("Hi", self.name + ",", "your average score is:", avg_score)

# Creating an instance of Student outside the class definition
s1 = Student("Tony Stark", [66, 88, 99])
s1.get_avg()
